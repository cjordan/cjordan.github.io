# Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am a fourth year Australian PhD student of astrophysics, studying at the [University of Tasmania](http://www.utas.edu.au/maths-physics/) and [CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science](http://www.csiro.au/Organisation-Structure/Divisions/Astronomy-and-Space-Science.aspx). Currently, my work is focused on researching high mass star formation through molecular spectral lines. Most of my experience in radio astronomy comes from the Australia Telescope Compact Array; with its fantastic new [correlator](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.416..832W), we are able to conduct powerful observations in efficient times. My PhD utilises this potential in the MALT-45 project. See the [research](/research) and [publications](/publications) pages for more details.

When I'm not studying, I enjoy learning new programming languages. [Go](http://golang.org/) holds my fascination at the moment. Perhaps when I finish my PhD, I can begin learning other human languages. Another pastime is [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/). When I'm not being productive with my time, I like to play video games. It is simultaneously a blessing and a curse that Valve's [Dota 2](http://blog.dota2.com/?l=english) works in Linux these days.


# Background

Before I studied astrophysics in my PhD degree, I completed a joint engineering-science degree, majoring in electrical engineering and mathematics. My attraction to astronomy stems from our limited overall knowledge; it's fascinating to think that so much of the natural universe still dwells within the realm of "magic." Radio astronomy constantly pushes the reach of our technology, and I'm glad to be helping that push.

During my PhD I have acquired many hours of teaching, mostly through tutoring undergraduate classes in engineering. More recently, I have been working part-time as a contract observer for [IVS](http://ivscc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) at the University of Tasmania.

I have spent a considerable amount of time with computers, particularly Linux systems, and have experience with a variety of programming languages. [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) is a personal favourite, being easy to read and write for efficient scripting of tasks. A variety of scripts I use are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/cjordan) page.
