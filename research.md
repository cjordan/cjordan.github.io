# Research interests
My exposure within star formation research includes:

+ dense gas tracers, such as $\text{CS}$ $(1-0)$ and $\text{NH}_3$ $(1,1)$
+ methanol masers, particularly the poorly understood Class I variety
+ continuum at 7mm, which can be attributed to dust or free-free emission

As I'm observational astronomer, I am interested working with other instruments, and perhaps regimes (sub-millimetre, near-infrared, etc.) [ALMA](http://www.almaobservatory.org/) is particularly exciting within the star formation community, providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity.

Currently, I have around 350 hours of experience on the Australia Telescope Compact Array, particularly with its relatively new 64M-32k correlator mode.

# Background: Star formation
Perhaps before touching on the question "what is star formation?" we should ask, what are stars?

Stars, to me, are freaks of nature. Looking into space, we see <em>vast</em> emptiness; it's mostly empty (hence space). Yet it's littered with these bright spots everywhere we look. Indeed, one may think of stars as the grains of sand that build the universe, but indulge me... <br /><br />

Stars represent regions of space where enough "stuff" is contained in the same place; so much so, that fusion is allowed to take place, and naturally radiates a huge amount of energy. A star would gladly colllapse upon itself further if it could, but its structure is provided by the intense fusion in the core. The fusion effectively pushes the mass "falling" into the core outwards. This "collapsing" and "pushing" results in a hydrostatic equilibrium, meaning that the size of the star depends on the strength of each force constantly fighting (gravity vs. outward pressure). If there's more mass, there's more gravity, but consequentally there's also more fusion. However, stars with more mass are bigger than those with less. <br /><br />

If there was less matter in these stars, these "failed stars" would <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf">barely shine</a>. Throw in some more material, and you get much more <a href="http://www.bo.astro.it/~eps/buz10201/ajf03.jpg">extreme</a> consequences. The point I'm trying to make here is that a star's behaviour is dominated by its mass. The mass of star owes to the nature of its birth. <br /><br />

So, how are stars born? <br /><br /><br />

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Clouds</h2>

When a cloud in space has enough material, it may collapse on itself, provided the gas that makes up the cloud is relatively "calm." The end product of such a cloud collapsing on itself is a star, or many stars. <br /><br />

I like to explain in very simple terms before progressing on to something more detailed. So... <br /><br />

The forebearer of a star is a cold, dense molecular cloud. Molecules are give-aways for cold and dense clouds, because space is too sparse and thus "hot" to contain many molecules. Provided a molecular cloud is sufficiently dense and quiescent, it will eventually self-gravitate to form an accreting young stellar object (YSO). This means there's a "star-like" object surrounded by a disc of inflowing gas - this is how the star grows. If enough gas has fallen in, the YSO will have begun fusion in its core, and have started its life as a main-sequence star. <br /><br />

At least, this is relatively obvious and well understood in the low mass case of star formation.

        <h1 class="featurette-heading">High mass star formation</h1>

The separation from low mass and high mass stars is at 8 solar masses (8 $M_\odot$). The prescription for high mass comes from those stars that end their lives in a supernova, rather than as a planetary nebula. <br /><br />

So we would expect that high mass stars are simply low mass stars that have eaten too much - what's special about them? <br /><br />

It turns out that our understanding of a YSO accreting matter is insufficient to explain how truly high mass stars are born. As mentioned previously, if enough gas has fallen in, the YSO will begin fusion. This step will happen much earlier than the star would have finished accreting, to provide it with enough mass to become "high mass." This is a significant problem, because the star begins to "blow away" infalling material, making accretion difficult if not impossible. Research has provided models that allow for stars to grow as big as 20 $M_\odot$, yet we see stars in space greater than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol_Star">80 $M_\odot$</a>. <br /><br />

Wow, how do these freaks come about? This is the field of research known as high mass star formation (HMSF).

# MALT-45

### Dense gas

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/research-page/cs.png">

This is where I enter the field of research. One product of my work I am particularly proud of is the above image. This is carbon monosulfide (CS) J=1-0 mapped by MALT-45. Regarding star formation, dense gas highlights where stars are born. The CS we have mapped is particularly useful, as it is only seen in very dense regions. Effectively, we are filtering the Galaxy for really dense clouds, aiding the search and understanding for HMSF.

MALT-45 (Millimetre Astronomers Legacy Team - 45 GHz) is a sensitive, untargeted survey of the Galactic plane for HMSF in the 7mm waveband (which is roughly 45 GHz). To date, 5 square-degrees have been mapped ($\text{l} = 330 - 335, \text{b} = \pm0.5$), as this amount of data was more than sufficient for the scope of my PhD thesis. My thesis will present data on:

+ $\text{CS}$ $(1-0)$
+ Class I methanol ($\text{CH}_3\text{OH}$) masers at 44 GHz
+ $\text{SiO}$ $(1-0)$ $v=1,2,3$ masers
+ $\text{SiO}$ $(1-0)$ $v=0$ thermal emission

More detailed information on MALT-45 can be obtained through my [publications](/publications), particularly the survey results paper (currently in preparation).
