Today, I delivered a presentation on an incredibly useful Ruby gem. It trivially allows you to execute iterables in parallel. More can be found in the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xZByKyo_Qoo-eJobTTaAfo1GtsGYuOHhX0xEvT-h200/edit?usp=sharing).

Off-topic, but last week I delivered another presentation on high-resolution ammonia maps towards high mass star forming regions, by Lu et al. 2014. The presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WjVSp6zu5mew7ZhD1VJmImshXHT97dkTZUWhmj38mIc/edit?usp=sharing).
